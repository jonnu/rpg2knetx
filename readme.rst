After many years, and many disappointments, with a samba share
filled with segments of code from repeated restarts, I am happy
to announce the latest version of rpg2knet.com's codebase.

If you wish to help development, drop me a line in IRC or just
freely branch and develop and submit pull requests.  The code 
follows a standard, please stick to it.  Please excuse my long
comments and messy hacks, a lot of this code is a large WIP!

************
requirements
************

The source code should run on most standard webservers. To 
install, paths may need altering in the bootstrap file 
(www/index.php) and the database will need configuring 
(src/config/database.php) & installing (todo... sorry!)

- PHP 5.1+
- MySQL 5.0+
- apache, or nginx
- CodeIgniter_.
